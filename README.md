# SharpVoronoiLib

C# implementation of generating a Voronoi diagram from a set of points in a plane (using Fortune's Algorithm) with edge clipping and border closure. This implementation guarantees O(n√óln(n)) performance.

# Installation

The library is available as `SharpVoronoiLib` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpVoronoiLib): `dotnet add package SharpVoronoiLib` via CLI or via your preferred NuGet package manager.

Alternatively, you can download the solution and either copy the `SharpVoronoiLib` project code or build the project and use the `SharpVoronoiLib.dll`.

# Use

Quick-start:

```
List<VoronoiSite> sites = new List<VoronoiSite>
{
    new VoronoiSite(300, 300),
    new VoronoiSite(300, 400),
    new VoronoiSite(400, 300)
};

List<VoronoiEdge> edges = VoronoiPlane.TessellateOnce(
    sites, 
    0, 0, 
    600, 600
);
```

The tesselation result for the given `VoronoiSite`s contains `VoronoiEdge`s and `VoronoiPoint`s. The returned collection contains the generated edges.

* `VoronoiEdge.Start` and `.End` are the start and end points of the edge.
* `VoronoiEdge.Right` and `.Left` are the sites the edge encloses. Border edges move clockwise and will only have the `.Right` site. And if no points are within the region, both will be `null`.
* Edge end `VoronoiPoint`s also contain a `.BorderLocation` specifying if it's on a border and which one.
* `VoronoiEdge.Neighbours` (on-demand) are edges directly "connecting" to this edge, basically creating a traversable edge graph.
* `VoronoiEdge.Length` (on-demand) is the distance between its end points.
* `VoronoiSite.Edges` (aka cell) contains the edges that enclose the site (the order is not guaranteed).
* `VoronoiSite.ClockwiseEdges` (on-demand) contains these edges sorted clockwise (starting from the bottom-right "corner" end point).
* `VoronoiSite.ClockwiseEdgesWound` (on-demand) contains these edges also "wound" in the clockwise order so their start/end points form a loop.
* `VoronoiSite.Neighbours` contains the site's neighbours (in the Delaunay Triangulation), that is, other sites across its edges.
* `VoronoiSite.Points` (on-demand) contains points of the site's cell, that is, edge end points / edge nodes.
* `VoronoiSite.ClockwisePoints` (on-demand) contains these points sorted clockwise (starting from the bottom-right "corner").
* `VoronoiPoint.Edges` are edges emerging from this point.
* `VoronoiPoint.Sites` (on-demand) are sites touching this point.

If closing borders around the boundary is not desired (leaving sites with unclosed edges/polygons):

```
List<VoronoiEdge> edges = VoronoiPlane.TessellateOnce(
    sites, 
    0, 0, 
    600, 600,
    BorderEdgeGeneration.DoNotMakeBorderEdges
);
```

Full syntax (leaving a reusable `VoronoiPlane` instance):

```
VoronoiPlane plane = new VoronoiPlane(0, 0, 600, 600);

plane.SetSites(sites);

List<VoronoiEdge> edges = plane.Tessellate();
```

(Note that the algorithm will ignore duplicate sites, so check `VoronoiSite.Tesselated` for skipped sites if duplicates are possible in your data.)

Sites can be quickly randomly-generated (this will guarantee no duplicates):

```
VoronoiPlane plane = new VoronoiPlane(0, 0, 600, 600);

plane.GenerateRandomSites(1000, PointGenerationMethod.Uniform); // also supports .Gaussian

plane.Tessellate();
```

Lloyds relaxation algorithm can be applied to "smooth" cells:

```
VoronoiPlane plane = new VoronoiPlane(0, 0, 600, 600);

plane.SetSites(sites);

plane.Tessellate();

List<VoronoiEdge> edges = plane.Relax();
// List<VoronoiEdge> edges = plane.Relax(3, 0.7f); // relax 3 times with 70% strength each time 
```

# MonoGame example

A very simple [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame) example is included in `MonoGameExample` project:

# Dependencies

The main library targets .NET 9.0 and .NET Standard 2.0, 2.1 and targets compatible OSes - Windows, Linux & macOS - and .NET and Mono frameworks - Xamarin, Mono, UWP, Unity, etc.

# Original library

The key differences from the [original VoronoiLib repo](https://github.com/Zalgo2462/VoronoiLib):
* Borders can be closed, that is, edges generated along the boundary
* Edges and points/sites contain additional useful data
* Multiple critical and annoyingly-rare bugs and edge cases fixes
* LOTS more unit testing

Known issues:
* The algorithm uses a lot of allocations, forcing garbage collection
